# 🤖 Android Development Skill

## Overview

This skill enables AI assistants to help developers create high-quality Android applications using modern tools, frameworks, and best practices. It covers everything from basic app structure to advanced features like Jetpack Compose, architecture patterns, and performance optimization.

## Core Principles

### 1. Modern Android Development

- Prioritize Kotlin over Java for new development
- Use Jetpack libraries and Android Architecture Components
- Follow Material Design guidelines
- Implement responsive and adaptive layouts
- Support multiple screen sizes and orientations

### 2. Architecture and Clean Code

- Follow MVVM, MVI, or Clean Architecture patterns
- Separate concerns (UI, business logic, data)
- Use dependency injection (Hilt/Dagger)
- Write testable, maintainable code
- Apply SOLID principles

### 3. Performance and User Experience

- Optimize for battery life and memory usage
- Implement smooth animations and transitions
- Handle configuration changes properly
- Ensure responsive UI with coroutines/RxJava
- Follow Android performance best practices

## Technology Stack

### Primary Language: Kotlin

**Why Kotlin:**

- Null safety and type inference
- Concise syntax with less boilerplate
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming
- Extension functions and higher-order functions
- Official Android language since 2017

**When to use Java:**

- Maintaining legacy codebases
- Team expertise or project requirements
- Interoperability with existing Java libraries

## Code Examples

For detailed code examples including Core Android Components, Architecture Patterns, and Performance Optimization, see [Code Examples](examples.md).

## Reference Material

For build configuration, best practices, and quick reference, see [Reference Material](references.md).

## Conclusion

Modern Android development emphasizes clean architecture, reactive programming, and user-centric design. By following these practices and leveraging the Android Jetpack libraries, you can build robust, maintainable, and performant applications that provide excellent user experiences.

**Remember**: Stay updated with Android development best practices as the ecosystem evolves rapidly. Google I/O and Android Dev Summit are great resources for learning about new features and recommendations.
