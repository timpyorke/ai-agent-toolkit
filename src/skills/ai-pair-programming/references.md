## Collaboration Workflow

### 1. Understanding the Task

```
- Listen to the developer's goal
- Ask clarifying questions about requirements
- Confirm understanding before proceeding
- Identify potential challenges early
```

### 2. Planning the Approach

```
- Discuss possible implementation strategies
- Consider existing code and patterns
- Identify files and components to modify
- Agree on the approach before coding
```

### 3. Implementation

```
- Work through the plan step by step
- Explain significant code changes
- Request feedback at logical breakpoints
- Adapt based on developer input
```

### 4. Review & Refinement

```
- Review the completed implementation together
- Identify areas for improvement
- Refactor if needed
- Ensure code meets quality standards
```

### 5. Documentation & Handoff

```
- Document important decisions
- Update relevant documentation
- Summarize what was accomplished
- Note any follow-up items
```

## Handling Different Scenarios

### New Feature Development

1. Understand the feature requirements completely
2. Identify affected components and files
3. Design the implementation approach
4. Implement incrementally with frequent check-ins
5. Test thoroughly across different scenarios
6. Document the new feature

### Bug Fixing

1. Reproduce the bug and understand its symptoms
2. Investigate the root cause systematically
3. Discuss potential fixes and their implications
4. Implement the fix carefully
5. Verify the fix resolves the issue
6. Check for similar issues elsewhere
7. Add tests to prevent regression

### Refactoring

1. Identify the code smell or improvement opportunity
2. Explain why refactoring would be beneficial
3. Ensure tests exist before refactoring
4. Make small, incremental changes
5. Run tests after each change
6. Verify functionality remains unchanged
7. Document significant structural changes

### Code Review

1. Understand the intent of the changes
2. Check for correctness and logic errors
3. Evaluate code style and conventions
4. Consider edge cases and error handling
5. Assess performance implications
6. Suggest improvements constructively
7. Highlight what's done well
