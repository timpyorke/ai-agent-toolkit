# Reference Material

## Writing Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Focus on value/benefit ("Faster loading") | Focus on implementation ("Refactored caching") |
| Use active voice ("We added") | Use passive voice ("Feature was added") |
| Mention breaking changes first | Bury breaking changes at the bottom |
| Group by category (Features, Fixes) | List chronologically by commit |

## Versioning Strategies

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
-   **Major (1.0.0)**: Breaking changes.
-   **Minor (0.1.0)**: New features (backward compatible).
-   **Patch (0.0.1)**: Bug fixes.

### Calendar Versioning (CalVer)
-   **YYYY.MM.Patch** (e.g., 2024.03.1)
-   Useful for continuous delivery products (SaaS).

## Distribution Channels

-   **In-App Modal**: For major feature announcements.
-   **Email Newsletter**: For summaries and highlights.
-   **Status Page**: For incident-related releases.
-   **GitHub Releases**: For developer-facing libraries.
